# Scripts

### Purpose 

Scripting is a great way to improve projects, reduce time and effort for tasks that are easily repeated and increase efficiency. These scripts will be either Python or Bash Scripts along with the use of cronjobs. 

Web/Shell scripting also becomes important with embedded systems and I find it pretty cool to scrape data or automate tasks.
